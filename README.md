# KBRW stack introduction


The objective of this repository is to introduce you to the elements of the 
KBRW development stack. 

- The `doc/` folder contains the chapters instructions.
- The `Resources` folder contains the associated files needed in some chapters.

## Purpose 

In this tutorial, we will introduce you to how to develop a website 
with a custom front end with React JS and a backend with Elixir. 

Through this tutorial you will be introduced to a bunch of open source
libraries available on github.

React. 

If you don't, we recommend you to read the tutorials available

You can also do some exercises on the [exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/elixir) web site.
