        You're about to start your KBRW training. This course will provide you
        with some guiding through the setup and building of a minimalist web
        project from scratch, KBRW style! You must understand a couple of things
        before you begin your journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>You must code !</strong> Reading some documentationss and
            tutorials is always a good start, but it's only by getting your
            hands dirty and trying to make something of what you just learned
            that you'll really learn something.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>You must struggle !</strong> A big part of this training is
            about you struggling with some setup or some code. We want you to
            get the full experience of working on a project at KBRW. Issues
            you'll deal with now will make you stronger and faster when you'll
            meet them again on your future project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>You must ask for help</strong> When you feel you've
            struggled for too long, don't hesitate to ask arround, to your
            future colleagues and especially to your KBRW tutor. We'll always
            find time to help you move pass the obstacles.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, as much effort as we put in this training, it's most likely
        outdated... Some parts or lines of code may not work, so you'll have to
        dig and find for yourself a path to resolution. But in case you're
        really struggling with something, checkout our #formation channel on
        Slack, as someone has probably already had the same issue. If not, ask
        arround, we'll help you get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        To follow your evolution and make sure you went through the entire
        training like a champion, your tutor will regularly assess your
        progression and give you feedback on your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        This training is designed to be completed in 4 to 5 weeks. At the end,
        you will have a meeting with a Kbrw senior developer to validate the
        notions of each chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, this training is not easy. Please take the time you need to do
        it thoroughly, so you fully understand our tools and ways of building
        projects.

        To have the best work environment for your training we recommand you to

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The lastest
          <strong>Ubuntu Long Term Support version (v 24.04 right now)</strong>,
          or equivalent
        </li>
        <li>
          Or the
          <strong>second to last macOS version (v 15.5 right now)</strong> if
          you're a <strong>Mac</strong> user
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We recommend you to <strong>never</strong> use the latest, bleeding edge
        version of anything, or you'll risk wasting time debugging some unseen,
        undocumented issues. And that's just not the purpose of this training,
        as we prefer you to focus on our stack.

        Keep in mind that you are not allowed to use Generative AI Models to
        help you through this training. This is related to three main reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any proprietary code you submit to the AI is not guarranteed to be
          kept secret by the model. There are chance it will use it as learning
          data and serve it back to other users.
        </li>
        <li>
          The code that the AI might write is not Open Source. Kbrw does not
          have the right to use it and own it. Within this training, it has no
          major implications, but if you get used to it, it will be a major
          legal issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of the formation is for you to learn. You will not learn as
          thoroughly if Chagpt does the exercises for you.

      <p>
        In this chapter we will get more familiar with <strong>Elixir</strong>,
        <strong>asdf</strong> and <strong>mix</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before coding anything, remember to create a git repository so we can
        follow your progression.
      </p>
      <div class="markdown-heading">
        <h2 class="heading-element">Step 0</h2>

          ><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span
        ></a>
      </div>
      <p>In this step we will introduce you to <code>asdf</code>.</p>
      <p>
        <code>asdf</code> is a software version manager, available on
        <a href="https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, we will use <strong>Elixir 1.11.3</strong>, one of the
        latest versions of Elixir. It may not be available as a package for your
        OS, but asdf provides you an with easy way to install it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First we need to clone and install <code>asdf</code> in our home
        directory as described on the <code>asdf</code> README.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we need to install the <strong>Erlang</strong> and the
        <strong>Elixir</strong> plugins. For that, you simply have to run the
        following commands.
      </p>
      <pre><code>asdf plugin add erlang
asdf plugin add elixir
asdf install erlang 28.0.1
asdf install elixir 1.18.4-otp-28
asdf set -u erlang 28.0.1
asdf set -u elixir 1.18.4-otp-28
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <em
          ><code>erlang</code> needs the following dependencies to work
          <code>libssl-dev</code>, <code>automake</code>,
          <code>autoconf</code> and <code>libncurses5-dev</code>.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The two first commands add <strong>erlang</strong> and
        <strong>elixir</strong> to the dependencies of <code>asdf</code>. The
        two seconds install, in a <code>asdf</code> folder,
        <strong>erlang</strong> and <strong>elixir</strong> in their respective
        versions <strong>28.0.1</strong> and <strong>1.18.4</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two last commands set the <strong>erlang</strong> and
        <strong>elixir</strong> installs available in a global environment. You
        can also set the <code>asdf</code> option to <code>local</code> to
        restrict the environment of your installation to the directory you are
        currently in and all it's child folders.

      <p>
        In this step we will discover how to create a <code>mix</code> project,
        compile it and run a <code>iex</code> instance in the
        <code>mix</code> project environment
      </p>
      <p>To create a <code>mix</code> project run the following command:</p>
      <pre><code>mix new &lt;nameofyourproject&gt; --sup
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This command will generate a mix project containing the different
        folders: <strong><code>config</code></strong
        >, <strong><code>lib</code></strong> and
        <strong><code>test</code></strong> with the file <code>mix.exs</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>mix.exs</strong> is the project description file. It
        contains an <strong>elixir</strong> module that <code>use</code> the
        library <strong><code>Mix.Project</code></strong> and implement the
        <code>mix</code> required functions to enable <code>mix</code> to
        compile our project.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>project</code> function returns the state of the project, with
          the version of <strong>elixir</strong> supposed to be used, the
          version of the project, ... This also declares the dependencies of the
          project in the <code>:deps</code> element by calling the function
          <code>deps</code> I will describe later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>application</code> function returns the list of applications and
          modules to start at the start up of the project. Here we have the
          <code>:logger</code> application, that enables a minimum log during
          the execution of the project. You can also specify the execution of a
          module on start up with the tag <code>:mod</code> in the list. Here,
          we start our <strong><code>TutoKBRWStack</code></strong> module. To
          start a module that way, the module must implement the following
          function :
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight highlight-source-elixir">
        <pre><span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">start</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">type</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-s1">args</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>deps</code> function returns the list of dependencies needed by
          the project. This will download the modules required in the folder
          <strong><code>deps</code></strong
          >. We will talk more deeply about this function and its implication
          later in this tutorial.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will now list the commands that you will need to compile, execute and
        reload a mix project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Compilation</strong>: To compile a mix project you need to run
        the command:
      </p>
      <pre><code>mix compile
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch</strong>: To launch the project, you can run the
        following command. Be careful, this command include the compilation of
        the project in it. This must be run in the root folder of your poject
      </p>
      <pre><code>iex -S mix
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Reload</strong>: You can reload the project while in an
        <code>iex</code> instance. The first way is to compile the project in a
        terminal and then in an <code>iex</code> instance already running type
        <code>r</code>
      </p>
      <pre><code>mix compile
iex&gt; r &lt;ModuleToReload&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Be careful here, reloading a sub module will only load this sub and all
        its submodules, while reloading the main module will load everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <code>iex</code> instance, running the following command is
        equivalent to run the above command on the main module.
      </p>
      <pre><code>iex&gt; recompile
</code></pre>
      <p>

        the <strong><code>Mix</code></strong> module is available on

      <ul>
        <li>
          Do you know the differences between a bitstring, a binary and a
          charlist ? How do you write them in Elixir ? In Erlang ?
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Bitstring is a list of integer from 0 to 256 (maximum 1 byte, and by default 1 byte).
            <pre><code>
iex> <<4>> 
iex> <<8, 2, 256>>
            </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            A Binary is exactly like a Bitstring, but each number is divisible by 8. Very usuful sfor some data structures, such as UTF-8 strings. The syntax is the same as the Bitstring.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Charlist is data structure not very used in Elixir, but well know in Erlang. We might face them when interacting with Erlang libraries. They are lists of integers where each integer point to a character. They can be anything from 0 to 1 114 111. 
          <pre><code>
iex> kbrw_charlist = ~c<q>kbrw</q>
~c<q>kbrw</q>

iex> IO.inspect(kbrw_charlist, charlists: :as_list)
[107, 98, 114, 119]
~c<q>kbrw</q> 
            </code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is the main difference between a Stream and an Enum ?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Both of those two functions can handle collections and iterate over them. But the difference is in the way they handle them. The Enum function will compute everything in the collection. But the Steam function will first evaluate what values will be compute, and then proceed to the update. For example, with a list of integer <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>, if we want to multiply every number and then filter only the odd numbers, the Enum function will iterate on every items, and then filter ; whereas the Steam function will multply only the odd numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Sort this data structures from the cheapest to the most expensive one
          in terms of number of operations and CPU time: List, Bitstring, Charlist.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Those three data structures are more or less linked list, so the time to move from an item to another is the same complexity O(n). However, the way they handle data is a bit different, so when we will start to dig into those data structures, the number of operations is not the same. The List is the most expensive, since every type of data can be into it, from the small interger to the gigantic object. Then, we have the Charlist, that only hold integers from 0 to 1 114 111. And finally, we have the Bitstring, which is a list of interger, but from 0 to 256.
